This is an extension of the vimconfig found at  git://github.com/railsjedi/snipmate-snippets.git

Changes
* Uses the much nicer Zenburn theme found here: http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ ;)
* Uses FuzzyFinder

Here's a nice video demonstrating a few plugins: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_galFWwSDt0

to use:
- clone this repo somewhere (I have it at ~/Vim/config)
    
    mkdir ~/Vim
    git clone git://github.com/railsjedi/vimconfig.git ~/Vim/config

- symlink the vim files to where you cloned it
    
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config ~/.vim
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

- clone my awesome snippet repo (or fork it and clone your own) 

    git://github.com/railsjedi/snipmate-snippets.git ~/Vim/snippets
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/snippets ~/Vim/config/snippets
