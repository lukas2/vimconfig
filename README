This is an extension of the very nice vimconfig found at https://github.com/railsjedi/vimconfig

Changes
* Uses the much nicer Zenburn theme found here: http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/ 
* Uses FuzzyFinder
* Uses Syntastic
* Small tweaks

Note: You need a recent Vim, 7.3 works, but 7.2 should suffice. It doesn't work with 7.1 (Ubuntu 8.4 Standard) for me.

Here's a nice video demonstrating a few plugins: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_galFWwSDt0

to use:
- clone this repo somewhere (I have it at ~/Vim/config)
    
    mkdir ~/Vim
    git clone git://github.com/lukas2/vimconfig.git ~/Vim

- symlink the vim files to where you cloned it
    
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config ~/.vim
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s $HOME/Vim/config/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
